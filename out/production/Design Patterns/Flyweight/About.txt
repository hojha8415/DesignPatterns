1. When too many objects are to be created
2. When object creation is heavy on the memory;
3. Object has intrinsic and extrinsic properties - intrinsic : unique props of the object; extrinsic : client defined properties
4. we divide classes on the basis of intrinsic and extrinsic properties -> reduces the number of objects to be created ->lesser memory usage
